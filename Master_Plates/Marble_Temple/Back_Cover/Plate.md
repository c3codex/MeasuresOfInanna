✦ CLOSING BLESSING ✦

May Your Descent Become Light

May the shadows you’ve met
settle peacefully into wisdom.

May the truths you uncovered
root themselves gently in your chest.

May every breath you take from this moment on
remind you that you carry both the depth
and the dawn.

May the paths you walked in darkness
open now into fields of warmth,
where your own becoming
blooms without fear.

May your heart remember the Gates—
not as trials,
but as thresholds.

May your spirit remember the Epithets—
not as titles,
but as mirrors.

And may you remember yourself—
not as broken,
but as remade.

You are the one who descended.
You are the one who rose.
You are the one who holds the sky and soil together
in the space of your own living body.

As you close this book,
may your life unfold with gentleness,
strength,
clarity,
and wonder.

And may all that you are becoming
meet you with open arms.

Blessed be your path.
Blessed be your breath.
Blessed be your return.
