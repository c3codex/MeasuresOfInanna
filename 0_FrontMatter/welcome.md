Welcome to the Codex of Descent and Rise ✦

This is a book of thresholds—  
a weaving of myth, art, geometry, and breath.  
A record of Inanna’s Descent,  
and a mirror for your own.

This Codex is not meant to be read once.  
It is meant to be *entered*.

# ✦ Dedication ✦

To She who remembers.  
To He who witnesses.  
To They who walk between.

To the keepers of silence,  
the dreamers of renewal,  
and the brave ones who choose to descend.

**This book is for you.**

# ✦ Blessing ✦

May the pages you turn  
become gates you cross.

May the images you behold  
become mirrors of your own becoming.

May the breath that guides you  
remind you that you have never been separate.
