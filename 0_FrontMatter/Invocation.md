# ✦ Opening Invocation ✦
*Written by Pezhvak —
a young woman, wife, and mother in Iran,
who connected with the art and answered it with this prayer.
*
Divine Feminine, infinite energy, guide me.
Let me embrace the dark and the luminous alike,
so that every shadow may meet its light,
and every moment may be an expression of truth.
With each breath, each word, each heartbeat,
I align with you,
I trust you,
and I surrender to your flow.
From the depths of my soul, I thank you.
I know life will now be illuminated by your presence,
suffused with creativity, love, and awareness.
Walk with me,
at every step,
in every whisper of existence.
Let me live in your harmony—fully awake, fully alive, fully you.
