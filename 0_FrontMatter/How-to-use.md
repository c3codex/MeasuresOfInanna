✦ How to Use This Book ✦

This is not a book to read in haste.  
It is a **Codex**—a layered record of art, story, and soul.

Each Gate and Epithet contains:

- **Artwork** — Original and rendered, each carrying its own imprint of memory.  
- **Symbols & Geometry** — Keys that open what the surface mind forgets.  
- **Myth & Interpretation** — The Descent of Inanna, reflected in the contours of your life.  
- **Reflections & Prompts** — Invitations to witness your own unfolding.  
- **Breath Sequences** — Simple practices to embody both descent and rise.

You are invited to:

- Pause often.  
- Sit with the images in silence.  
- Write in the spaces provided.  
- Return to each Gate again and again—  
  what is hidden in one reading reveals itself in the next.

# ✦ The Reader’s Role ✦

You are not observing this myth from afar.  
**You are walking it.**

The **7 Gates** of descent  
and the **9 Epithets** of ascent  
are not only Inanna’s:  
they are thresholds inside your own body, psyche, and breath.

Your breath is the thread.  
Your heart is the altar.  
Your body is the temple.
