1. Mythic Interpretation

At the first gate, Inanna arrives adorned in her full celestial regalia.
Neti, the gatekeeper of the Great Below, delivers Ereshkigal’s decree with ritual precision:

“At this gate, Inanna, you must give up the sag-uš,
the crown of your head.”

The sag-uš is more than a headdress.
It is the šugurra — the crescent crown of the morning star, the emblem of sovereignty, cosmic order, and the power to speak for both heaven and earth.

By removing the crown, Inanna relinquishes:
	•	rank
	•	identity
	•	celestial authority
	•	her title as Queen of Heaven

In Sumerian cosmology, bowing the head is not submission.
It is ritual unmaking — the deliberate dismantling of all constructed identity.

Thus the descent begins not with loss, but with truth:

Sovereignty cannot be worn.
It can only be remembered.

At this first threshold, Inanna removes the symbol of who she once was, stepping toward the Great Below in her most essential form.

The descent begins.

2. Breath Rite — The SAG-UŠ Cycle

Syllabic Mantra:

SAG – UŠ – SAG – UŠ

(4-syllable cycle, repeated 7 times)

This breath mirrors the lifting of the crown and the release of identity.
	•	Inhale on SAG
Draw breath up the central channel,
feeling the crown of the head open like a star.
	•	Hold on UŠ
Sense the weight of the titles, roles, and names you have carried.
	•	Exhale on SAG
Release the crown into the void,
letting the breath fall like a garment cast aside.
	•	Rest on UŠ
Bareheaded.
Unnamed.
Present.

Repeat 7 cycles, one for each Gate of Inanna’s descent.

3. Reflection Prompts
	•	What identities have I worn so long that I’ve mistaken them for myself?
	•	Which crown — social, familial, spiritual, or personal — has grown too heavy to bear?
	•	Who am I without the things I have been praised for or recognized by?
	•	Can I imagine sovereignty that rises from within rather than from what I wear?

4. Geometry + Artist Insight

This Gate emerged inside a circle — the oldest of cosmic geometries.
In Sumerian symbology, the circle represents totality, continuity, and the turning of the heavens.
It is not merely a shape; it is cosmic inevitability.

Behind Inanna, the zodiacal ring forms a halo not of divinity, but of law:
a reminder that celestial authority belongs to the order of the skies, not to her alone.

In the earliest sketch, the crown trembled.
The lines refused to settle, as though the image itself resisted being drawn.
Only once the circle stabilized did the crown soften.
The geometry held firm; the regalia surrendered.

In creating this piece, I learned how subtle the crown truly is.
It is not rigid metal —
it is energetic, responsive to alignment.

When the circle finally locked into place, the crown released its weight.

And I understood:

The crown was never hers to keep.
The circle was the true sovereign.

And so the crown lifts,
and the descent begins.
